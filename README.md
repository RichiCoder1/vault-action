# vault-action

A helper action for easily pulling secrets from HashiCorp Vault™.

By default, this action pulls from  [Version 2](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2/) of the K/V Engine. See examples below for how to [use v1](#using-kv-version-1) as well as [other non-K/V engines](#other-secret-engines).

## Example Usage

```yaml
jobs:
    build:
        # ...
        steps:
            # ...
            - name: Import Secrets
              uses: RichiCoder1/vault-action
              with:
                url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
                token: ${{ secrets.VaultToken }}
                secrets: |
                    ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
                    ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ;
                    ci npm_token
            # ...
```

## Authentication method

While most workflows will likely use a vault token, you can also use an `approle` to authenticate with Vault. You can configure which by using the `method` parameter:

- **token**: (by default) you must provide a `token` parameter
```yaml
...
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  token: ${{ secrets.VaultToken }}
```
- **approle**: you must provide a `roleId` & `secretId` parameter
```yaml
...
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  method: approle
  roleId: ${{ secrets.roleId }}
  secretId: ${{ secrets.secretId }}
```
- **github**: you must provide the github token as `githubToken`
```yaml
...
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  method: github
  githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

If any other method is specified and you provide an `authPayload`, the action will attempt to `POST` to `auth/${method}/login` with the provided payload and parse out the client token.

## Key Syntax

The `secrets` parameter is a set of multiple secret requests separated by the `;` character.

Each secret request is comprised of the `path` and the `key` of the desired secret, and optionally the desired Env Var output name.

```raw
{{ Secret Path }} {{ Secret Key or Selector }} | {{ Env/Output Variable Name }}
```

### Simple Key

To retrieve a key `npmToken` from path `ci` that has value `somelongtoken` from vault you could do:

```yaml
with:
    secrets: ci npmToken
```

`vault-action` will automatically normalize the given secret selector key, and set the follow as environment variables for the following steps in the current job:

```bash
NPMTOKEN=somelongtoken
```

You can also access the secret via outputs:

```yaml
steps:
    # ...
    - name: Import Secrets
      id: secrets
      # Import config...
    - name: Sensitive Operation
      run: "my-cli --token '${{ steps.secrets.outputs.npmToken }}'"

```

_**Note:** If you'd like to only use outputs and disable automatic environment variables, you can set the `exportEnv` option to `false`._

### Set Output Variable Name

However, if you want to set it to a specific name, say `NPM_TOKEN`, you could do this instead:

```yaml
with:
    secrets: ci npmToken | NPM_TOKEN
```

With that, `vault-action` will now use your requested name and output:

```bash
NPM_TOKEN=somelongtoken
```

```yaml
steps:
  # ...
  - name: Import Secrets
    id: secrets
    # Import config...
  - name: Sensitive Operation
    run: "my-cli --token '${{ steps.secrets.outputs.NPM_TOKEN }}'"

```

### Multiple Secrets

This action can take multi-line input, so say you had your AWS keys stored in a path and wanted to retrieve both of them. You can do:

```yaml
with:
    secrets: |
        ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
        ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Nested Secrets

By default, `vault-action` will read the key specified of `data.data` for the K/V v2 engine (default), or `data` for K/V v1 and other secrets engines (see below for more info).
If you need to retrieve a sub-key from a JSON document, or are interested in some other component of the Vault response, you can specify a different key as the path to the desired out.

_**Important**_: You must specify an [Output Variable Name](#set-output-variable-name) when using this method.

```yaml
with:
    secrets: |
        my/path pair.key | NESTED_SECRET ;
```

Under the covers, we're using [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) to provide the querying functionality. Any valid JSONata syntax is valid here, and will be outputed as a `JSON.stringify`-ied result.

### Using K/V version 1

By default, `vault-action` expects a K/V engine using [version 2](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2.html).

In order to work with a [v1 engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1/), the `kv-version` parameter may be passed:

```yaml
with:
    kv-version: 1
```

## Custom K/V Engine Path

When you enable the K/V Engine, by default it's placed at the path `secret`, so a secret named `ci` will be accessed from `secret/ci`. However, [if you enabled the secrets engine using a custom `path`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/secrets/enable/#inlinecode--path-4), you
can pass it as follows:

```yaml
with:
    path: my-secrets
    secrets: ci npmToken
```

This way, the `ci` secret in the example above will be retrieved from `my-secrets/ci`.

## Other Secret Engines

While this action primarily supports the K/V engine, it is possible to request secrets from other engines in Vault.

To do so when specifying the `Secret Path`, just append a leading forward slash (`/`) and specify the path as described in the Vault API documentation.

For example, to retrieve a stored secret from the [`cubbyhole` engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/secret/cubbyhole/), assuming you have a stored secret at the path `foo` with the contents:

```json
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "zip": "zap"
}
```

You could request the contents like so:

```yaml
with:
    secrets: |
        /cubbyhole/foo foo ;
        /cubbyhole/foo zip | MY_KEY ;
```

Resulting in:

```bash
FOO=bar
MY_KEY=zap
```

```yaml
steps:
  # ...
  - name: Import Secrets
    id: secrets
    # Import config...
  - name: Sensitive Operation
    run: "my-cli --token '${{ steps.secrets.outputs.foo }}'"
  - name: Another Sensitive Operation
    run: "my-cli --token '${{ steps.secrets.outputs.MY_KEY }}'"
```

Secrets pulled from the same `Secret Path` are cached by default. So if you, for example, are using the `aws` engine and retrieve a key, only a single key for a given path is returned.

e.g.:

```yaml
with:
    secrets: |
        /aws/creds/ci access_key | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
        /aws/creds/ci secret_key | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

would work fine.

*NOTE: Per [Nested Secrets](#nested-secrets), the `Key` is pulled from the `data` property of the response.*

## Adding Extra Headers

If you ever need to add extra headers to the vault request, say if you need to authenticate with a firewall, all you need to do is set `extraHeaders`:

```yaml
with:
    secrets: |
        ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
        ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    extraHeaders: |
      X-Secure-Id: ${{ secrets.SECURE_ID }}
      X-Secure-Secret: ${{ secrets.SECURE_SECRET }}
```

This will automatically add the `x-secure-id` and `x-secure-secret` headers to every request to Vault.

## Vault Enterprise Features

### Namespace

If you need to retrieve secrets from a specific Vault namespace, all that's required is an additional parameter specifying the namespace.

```yaml
steps:
    # ...
    - name: Import Secrets
      uses: RichiCoder1/vault-action
      with:
        url: https://vault-enterprise.mycompany.com:8200
        method: token
        token: ${{ secrets.VaultToken }}
        namespace: ns1
        secrets: |
            ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
            ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ;
            ci npm_token
```

## Masking - Hiding Secrets from Logs

This action uses GitHub Action's built-in masking, so all variables will automatically be masked (aka hidden) if printed to the console or to logs.
**This only obscures secrets from output logs.** If someone has the ability to edit your workflows, then they are able to read and therefore write secrets to somewhere else just like normal GitHub Secrets.

## Normalization

To make it simpler to consume certain secrets as env vars, if no Env/Output Var Name is specified `vault-action` will replace and `.` chars with `__`, remove any other non-letter or number characters. If you're concerned about the result, it's recommended to provider an explicit Output Var Key.
